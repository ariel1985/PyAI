## Memory Types
RAM - Random Access Memory (Stack & Heap) - mutable 
ROM - Read Only Memory - immutable

## Variables:

    VariableName = Value

### Keywords
Saved words that are not to be used as variable names
[Keywords](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list)

### Basic usage of variables
Python is not strongly typed means we can use the same variable name for different types of values

### Variable names guide lines:
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

## Casting

# Homework
1. Create a variable for each data type
2. Create a script that asks the user for a height and width of a square and prints the area (height * width)
3. Create a script that asks the user for the height and width of a triangle and prints the area of the triangle as an integer
4. What is the type (or error) of each of the variables (try to find out before checking them with type() function):
   
```
    x = 1
    x = '1'
    x = "3.14159"
    x = 'hello'
    x = True
    x = 'True'
    x = false
    x = -88
    x = "-55"
    x = '_'
    x = bool(0)
    x = bool(0.3)
    x = bool('')
    x = bool(-1)
    x = int('-30')
    x = float(0)
    x = float('2')
    x = 1+4
    x = 3+.5
    x = 4/4
    x = 0/8
    x = 8/0
```
